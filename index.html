  <h1>Mark Catesby</h1>
  <p>Mark Catesby (24 March 1683 â€“ 23 December 1749) was an English naturalist. Between 1729 and 1747 Catesby published his <i>Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands</i>, the first published account of the flora and fauna of North America. It included 220 plates of birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects, mammals and plants.</p>
  <h2>Life and works</h2>
  <p>Catesby was born on 24 March 1683 and baptised at Castle Hedingham, Essex on 30 March 1683. His father, John Catesby (buried 12 November 1703), was a local politician and gentleman farmer. His mother was Elizabeth Jekyll (buried 5 September 1708). The family owned a farm and house, Holgate, in Sudbury, Suffolk as well as property in London. An acquaintance with the naturalist John Ray led to Catesby becoming interested in natural history. The death of his father left Catesby enough to live on, so in 1712, he accompanied his sister Elizabeth to Williamsburg, Virginia. She was the wife of Dr. William Cocke, who had been a member of the Council and Secretary of State for the Colony of Virginia. According to their father's will, Elizabeth had married Dr. Cocke against her father's wishes.[1] Catesby visited the West Indies in 1714, and returned to Virginia, then home to England in 1719.</p>
